# Singly Linked List

### What is a Singly Linked List?
  * consists of nodes
  * each node has a value and a pointer to the next node (or null at the end of the list)
  * has a head (=start), a tail (=end) and a length
  * has no index like an Array
  * "singly" because only one connection to another node (the next one)
  * access has always to start from the start (O(N))
  * insertion is cheap (O(1))
  * deletion can be cheap (O(1) (head) or O(N) (tail)) 

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

  ###  create three methods for the linked list

  * insert to the head of the list
  * inclouds => that search for the value if its inside the list or not
  * toString => thats return all the values inside the list as a string like this {10}->{9}->{8}->{7}->{6}->{5}->NULL

## Approach & Efficiency
  #### thats the first time to use another datastrucher diffrent then arrays and i find it hard at the beging but now its easy
