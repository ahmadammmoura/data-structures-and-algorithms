# Graphs

##### A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices (also called nodes or points), together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

## Challenge

1. Add vertex
  
2. add edge
 
3. get neighbors
 
4. get nodes
 
5. size
